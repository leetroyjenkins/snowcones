Overview

The Azure Core Organization is responsible for creating the foundation of Microsoft’s Cloud Platform for utility computing. This platform is one of the lowest levels of the services software/hardware stack and includes an efficient, virtualized computational substrate, a fully automated service management system, and a comprehensive set of highly scalable storage services.

The Azure Compute Capacity and Efficiency (AC2E) team is the team in Azure Core tasked with managing all aspects of Compute capacity and efficiency management across the fleet. Capacity Management needs to ensure that on the one hand, there is sufficient capacity across all regions, allocation domains, and hardware infrastructure to meet all customer demand, while on the other hand ensuring that capacity is provisioned efficiently thereby avoiding overspending and COGS/CAPEX impact. At the scale of Azure’s business, managing this trade-off across the entire Azure Compute fleet is an enormously complex  task, where improvements can make the difference between customer allocation failures on the one hand, and gargantuan savings on the other.

As a Data Engineer in the team, you will work closely with our software engineers, program managers, and data scientists across different teams within Azure Core. You will also collaborate with a variety of internal partner teams across Azure and Microsoft. You will build reliable, secured, highly scalable, performant data pipelines to enhance the Azure Compute allocation, deliver capacity management and efficiency improvements. The value of your work will be reflected in improvements to the Azure platform, Azure service capacity fulfillment rate, customer satisfaction, and various efficiency metrics, including COGS reduction. You will have opportunities for mentorship, accelerate your career growth, and work on truly high-business impact areas.

Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.

 

In alignment with our Microsoft values, we are committed to cultivating an inclusive work environment for all employees to positively impact our culture every day.
